# Resolving Load Shedding

## Requirements to process electricty
* Oil 
* Gas
* Coal

## Alternatives to solving load shedding
* Solar
* Hydro power station
* Wind - using big wind mill to generate electricty
* Geothermal - power plant use steam from reservoirs hot water from below the earth surface

## Integration of the Graph Solution 

* Resource allocation of the requiremnts of to process electricty
* Graph that will run a system based on enviromental conditions, to provide electricty using the alternative resource to provide electricty.


## Needs for the proposal 
* Eskom Problem Description
* Graph Mapping:/Node
* Problem Graph Mapping:Edges/
* Problem Graph Mapping :Overall
* Project justification
